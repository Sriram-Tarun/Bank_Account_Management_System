# Bank_Account_Management_System

This Bank API is a simple and efficient banking system built using Spring Boot and MySQL, allowing users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their balances. It follows a RESTful architecture, making it easy to integrate with front-end applications or other systems. The project is developed using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.3.4, and Spring Data JPA for database interactions. MySQL is used as the database, and Lombok is included to reduce boilerplate code.
